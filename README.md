# Practice-Repository---CL-Workshop

# Introduction

The following repository will serve as a sample to guide the development of a repository for a future corpus. As a researcher interested in studying Spanish as a heritage language, I intend to increase the available to data that is accessible to researchers in the field. To do this, I intend to develop a corpus of spoken heritage language.

# Goals

My primary goals for creating a corpus relate to the necessity to disseminate research around this community of speakers. The field is expanding more and more with new research developing; therefore, it is important to increase the understanding and awareness of this community regarding both their language usage and their unique cultural experiences.

# Broader Impacts

Through the development of a corpus dedicated to heritage language, researchers can begin to more easily access data on heritage Spanish. Given the current conditions researchers face due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the availability of corpora has become more important than ever as labs like my own are trying to navigate continuing research endeavors while maintaining safe social distancing and health practices.
